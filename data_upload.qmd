```{r}
lebron_data <- load_nba_player_box(season = 2022) |> 
  filter(athlete_display_name == "LeBron James") |>
  drop_na()
```

```{r}
data <- tibble(nba_leaguedashplayershotlocations(league_id = '00', season = year_to_season(most_recent_nba_season() - 1))) 

shot_data <-  tibble(nba_shotchartdetail(league_id = '00', player_id = '202696', season = year_to_season(most_recent_nba_season() - 1)))
data <- shot_data[[1]][[1]] |> mutate(LOC_X = as.numeric(LOC_X), LOC_Y = as.numeric(LOC_Y))
```

```{r}
data <- data |> mutate(xx = LOC_X/10, y = LOC_Y/10 - 41.75)
```
